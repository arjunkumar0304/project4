# Git & Github
Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

# 8.Undoing changes:
# revert (safe way):
Git revert is a Git command used to undo changes made by a previous commit — but without deleting any history.
Instead of removing the commit, it creates a new commit that reverses the changes.

# Reset:
git reset moves your branch pointer to an earlier commit, removing later commits.
It can unstage or delete changes depending on the mode (--soft, --mixed, or --hard).

# 9.Git hooks:
Git hooks are scripts that run automatically when certain Git actions occur (like commit, push, or merge).
They’re used to automate tasks such as checking code style, running tests, or verifying commit messages before changes are applied.

# 10. Submodules:
Git submodules are used to add one Git project inside another.
They help link and use another repository without copying its code.
